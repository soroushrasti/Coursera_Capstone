The key problem in this project is which neighbourhood is suitable for a specific style restaurant that he/she going to open.

    "\n",
    "2- From the restaurants in each neighbourhood, which style they are. The will help the business owner to decide the best area for her/his restaurant. For example if he/she wants to open a Mexican restaurant, then it is better  to open it in a neighbourhood with fewer Mexican restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- What buildings are more in that neighbourhood? Are there a lot of commercial, educational or amusement places around? Areas with these types of places can help to attract more customers and making an ideal location.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At first I get a list of neighbourhoods in Toronto from the Wikipedia webpage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M. \n",
    "Transforming this table to a data frame makes the analysis a lot easier.\n",
    "The Foursquare API was used to acquire number of venues belonging to each postal code and neighborhood of Toronto. In addition using the Foursquare API, I will get the location data, like latitudes and longitudes of each venue. Based on that I can easily show you the location of each venue on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, with the power of data analysis packages like Pandas, I will sort out the venue and restaurants lists and gave you some basics information about the frequency of each of them in the Toronto city. Interestingly, using that I will make the city into five zones based on the frequencies of each venue and restaurants category. \n",
    "The data sorted by restaurant type can show the prominent style in each neighbourhood. Information such as venue type and frequency of each venue was used to determine if the venues nearby are more likely to attract customers.\n",
    "Then you can very easily see how many percents of each venue belongs to which city zone and based on that you will understand frequency of each venue was used to determine which neighbourhood has a higher potential for attracting customers. This tremendously would help to decide wisely where you can start your restaurant. \n",
